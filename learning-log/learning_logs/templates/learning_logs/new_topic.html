  <!-- Django uses the template tag {% csrf_token %} to prevent attackers
from using the form to gain unauthorized access to the server (this kind of
attack is called a cross-site request forgery) -->

<!-- We only need to include the template variable {{ form.as_p }} for Django to create
all the fields necessary to display the form automatically. The as_p modifier
tells Django to render all the form elements in paragraph format, which is
a simple way to display the form neatly.
Django doesnâ€™t create a submit button -->
